# Portfolio v2

This is a revamped version of my portfolio. I want my portfolio to be concise, easy to read, easy to follow, and informative. This version will accomplish that.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
