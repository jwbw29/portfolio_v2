      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a Full Stack Engineer with past work experience as a Product
        Owner. I have years of experience in Product Strategy and Development,
        learning from users and how to build a user-friendly product. I wanted
        to do more of the building myself and decided to become a full-stack
        engineer. I enjoy learning new and better ways to do things and then
        applying those skills to see an idea come to reality.
